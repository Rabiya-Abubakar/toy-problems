## Challenge 2: Speed Detector 

This project contains a program that takes the speed of a car as input and outputs the appropriate response based on the speed. If the speed is less than 70, it will print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it will give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function will print “License suspended”.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic speed detection algorithm implemented in JavaScript. The program evaluates the speed of a car and applies demerit points for speeding above a specified limit. If the accumulated demerit points exceed a threshold, the program will indicate that the driver's license should be suspended.

## Example
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Installation

To use the speed detector function, clone the repository and include the `speedDetector.js` file in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rabiya-Abubakar/toy_assignment.git
