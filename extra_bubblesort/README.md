## Introduction

This project provides a JavaScript function that sorts an array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm. It serves as an example of basic sorting techniques in JavaScript.

## Example
(BubbleSort)
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input. It should output an array of those same numbers sorted from lowest to highest.

sample input = [5,6,1,3,4,2]
Expected output = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Research Areas: 
1. Loops 
2. Array Methods 

## Installation

To use the sorting function, clone the repository and include the `sort.js` file in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rabiya-Abubakar/toy_assignment.git
