## Introduction

This project provides a JavaScript class that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The volume is computed using the formula: 

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The result is rounded to four decimal places.

## Example
(Objects)
3. Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder with four decimal places using object classes.
Volume of a cylinder : V = Ï€r2h where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

Research Areas 
1. Objects. 
2. Object constructor.
3. constructor templates.

## Installation

To use the cylinder volume calculation class, clone the repository and include the `Cylinder.js` file in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rabiya-Abubakar/toy_assignment.git
